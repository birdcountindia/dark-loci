# Dark Loci

Dark Loci is a project started in 2022-23, with the aim of identifying broad regions within India that are underbirded and therefore underrepresented in eBird data. The insights from this project have been used to strategically plan roadshows and other targeted interventions in the respective regions, in order to kickstart birding momentum. The name was inspired by the [eBirding coverage dot maps](https://birdcount.in/ebirding-india/) produced by BCI, which represent data presence as yellow dots and absence as the dark background. 

The analysis uses a combination of data quantity (no. of lists) and inventory completeness (current species richness vs expected species richness) at the district level to classify each of India’s districts into "concern" statuses. These statuses are either broad (categorical) or slightly finer (ordinal). These data are regularly monitored, and new “dark loci clusters” are identified as groups of many high-concern districts clustered together. Selecting such geographical clusters helps make our interventions such as roadshows more effective and efficient. Finally, for each identified cluster, certain metrics are calculated and tracked on a monthly basis. The hope is for these districts to gradually fall into lower concern statuses, especially those with targeted interventions.
